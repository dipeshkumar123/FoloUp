Here's a [loom](https://www.loom.com/share/762fd7d12001490bbfdcf3fac37ff173?sid=9a5b2a5a-64df-4c4c-a0e7-fc9765691f81) of me explaining the app.

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoloUp/FoloUp.git
```

2. Copy the existing environment template file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Clerk Setup ([Clerk](https://clerk.com/))

We use Clerk for authentication. Set up Clerk environment variables in the `.env` file. Free plan should be more than enough.

1. Navigate to [Clerk](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) and create an application following the [setup guide](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faa72830-10b0-4dfd-8f07-792e7520b6a2" alt="Clerk Environment Variables" width="800">

2. Your `.env` (NOT `.env.local`) file should have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` variables populated with **no inverted commas**

3. Enable organizations in your Clerk application by navigating to the [Organization Settings](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings&_gl=1*58xbvk*_gcl_au*MTEzODk3NzAyMy4xNzM4NjQzMzU3*_ga*MzUyMTk4NzIwLjE3Mzg2NDM0NzY.*_ga_1WMF5X234K*MTczODczNzkxOC4zLjEuMTczODczNzkyNi4wLjAuMA..) page.

4. Make sure you create an organization and invite your email to it.

## Database Setup ([Supabase](https://supabase.com/))

Supabase is used for storing the data. It's really simple to set up and the free plan should suffice.

1. Create a project (Note down your project's password)
2. Got to SQL Editor and copy the SQL code from `supabase_schema.sql`
3. Run the SQL code to confirm the tables are created (the file now includes the
   `integrity_signals`, `face_presence_pct`, `video_url`, and `video_storage_path`
   columns used by the enhanced suite).
4. Create a public Storage bucket named `interview-videos` (see the bottom of
   `supabase_schema.sql` for the one-liner) — this is where the candidate video
   recordings land.
5. Copy the supabase url and anon key from the project settings and paste it in the `.env` file in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Retell AI Setup ([Retell AI](https://retellai.com/))

We use Retell AI to manage all the voice calls. They manage storage of recordings and provide a simple SDK to integrate with. They provide free credits to start with and will have to pay as you go.

1. Create an API key from [Retell AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.retellai.com/apiKey) and add it to the `.env` file in `RETELL_API_KEY`

## LLM Setup (Groq by default, OpenAI as fallback)

We use a single LLM client (`src/lib/llm.ts`) to call whichever provider you
configure. **Groq is the default** — it's OpenAI-API-compatible, much faster,
and has a generous free tier. The same Node `openai` SDK is used; the client
just points at `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` when Groq is selected.

1. **Groq (recommended)**
   - Create a free API key at [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys).
   - Add it to `.env` as `GROQ_API_KEY=...`
   - Default model: `openai/gpt-oss-120b` (production).
   - **Automatic model fallback** — if the default model is unavailable
     (e.g. Groq retires it), the client walks down the chain
     `gpt-oss-120b → gpt-oss-20b → qwen3.6-27b → llama-3.1-*` until one
     succeeds. The first working model is cached for the rest of the
     process so you don't pay the 404-retry penalty on every call.

2. **OpenAI (fallback)**
   - Create an API key at [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
   - Add it to `.env` as `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`
   - Set `LLM_BACKEND=openai` to force OpenAI even when a Groq key is present.
   - Fallback chain: `gpt-4o → gpt-4o-mini → gpt-4-turbo → gpt-3.5-turbo`.

3. **Override the model**
   - Set `LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b` (Groq) or `LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini`
     (OpenAI) in `.env` to pin a specific model.

4. **Health check**
   - Hit `http://localhost:3000/api/llm-health` to confirm the LLM is
     reachable and see which backend + model is active. Returns 200 on
     success, 503 on failure with the underlying error.

## Getting Started locally

First install the packages:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Enhanced suite

This branch ships four new UIs that slot into the existing app — no separate
demo mode, all of them render against your real data:

| # | Feature | Where to look |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | **Create AI Interview** — 4-step wizard with template gallery, persona stats, live candidate preview, auto-saved drafts | `src/components/enhanced/create-interview/CreateInterviewWizard.tsx`, mounted in `src/components/dashboard/interview/createInterviewCard.tsx` |
| 2 | **Candidate Feedback Dashboard** — single-screen overview with KPIs, score histogram, sentiment + status bars, tabbed deep-dive | `src/components/enhanced/feedback-dashboard/FeedbackDashboard.tsx`, mounted in `src/app/(client)/interviews/[interviewId]/page.tsx` |
| 3 | **Anti-Cheat Suite** — 8 signal types (tab, blur, fullscreen exit, copy/paste, right-click, devtools, text selection, face-presence) | `src/components/enhanced/anti-cheat/*`, wired into `src/components/call/index.tsx` |
| 4 | **AI Video Interview** — parallel MediaRecorder track alongside the Retell audio call | `src/components/enhanced/video-interview/VideoInterviewLayer.tsx`, wired into the call page; uploads to Supabase Storage bucket `interview-videos` |

A self-contained `/demo` route group is also kept (so reviewers can click
through without any backend) at `src/app/demo/`.

## Self Hosting

We recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the app.
